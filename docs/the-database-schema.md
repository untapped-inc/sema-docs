# The Database Schema

The data structure is designed to incorporate the unique business practices of various safe water enterprises. The structure is broad enough to serve the entire SWE sector, yet allows for customization to serve the unique business practices of each SWE.

We decided to document the database on a different page because we're using a software called <a href="http://schemaspy.org/" target="_blank">SchemaSpy</a>. SchemaSpy allows us to provide more technical details about the database - i.e.: Constraints, relationships, etc...

<a href="http://sema.untapped-inc.com/docs/dbdoc" target="_blank">Click here</a> to visit the database documentation.

SchemaSpy uses the MySQL comments to add details to each table and their columns. In the future, we will also add sub-sections to this section for each table so we can provide even more in-depth info about each table, their columns and their purpose.

If you see a bug on that page or any missing details, please, feel free to leave a comment down below.
