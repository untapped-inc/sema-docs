## How is this doc structured?

This technical documentation was designed to be easily browsable. Here's what to expect:

- On the left side, you will find the listing of each main section.
- In the middle resides the content of the current section. In the top right corner of every content, you'll notice a pencil icon that links directly to the source code of the current content so you can edit the content and make a pull request so you can contribute to it.
- On the right side, there is a table of contents that lists sub-sections of the current section.
- In the top right, you can search throughout the whole documentation and also get basic information about our main repository from Github. You can also click on the link to visit it.
- Right before the footer, at the end of each page, you can easily go to the previous or the next section.
- Most sections have their own <a href="https://disqus.com" target="_blank">Disqus</a> comment[^about-comments] sub-section at the end where developers and people who read the docs can ask questions about the section.
- Each sub-section has the paragraph symbol `Â¶` link at the end of its headline - when you hover your cursor over it - that makes it possible to directly link to that sub-section.
- Some pages on the navigation menu have sub-pages and they are listed in a dropdown list. Some sub-pages even have their own sub-pages.
- This whole documentation site is responsive, it'll look good and browsable on both desktop and mobile devices.

And that's it. We hope you enjoy browsing around this doc as much as we enjoyed writing it. Feel free to leave a comment on a section if you see anything wrong or if something is not clear enough. Our core developers will get back to you shortly and this will definitely help others who come after.
