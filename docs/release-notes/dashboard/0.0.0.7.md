# Dashboard Version 0.0.0.7

This version includes preliminary implementation of **Water Operations** and **Sales**. **Distribution Map, Delivery Schedule, Inventory Management** and **Financials** contain only 'static' images of what the feature will include when implemented

The
 data shown is for the "most recent' data in the Sema database. The Sema
 database is a 'snapshot' of the DloHaiti production database and 
contains data up until mid-may 2018. (Of course not all kiosks will 
contain data up until mid-may 2018.)

## Known limitations and issues

### Water operations:

- Only
 the most 'recent months data' is shown for production, chlorine and TDS
 charts. Eventually the UI will allow previous data. E.g. last months as
 well as data by year/quarter or week etc.
- Some kiosks show 'negative' wastage ??? (We need to determine the fault... Is the data incorrect or the algorithm?)

### Sales

- Only
 the most 'recent months data' is shown. Eventually the UI will allow 
previous data. E.g. last months as well as data by year/quarter or week 
etc.
- Data for customer growth, new customers etc. is not 
available as the customer_accounts table doesn't (yet) contain date 
information
- Net Income data is not available as the receipts table doesn't  (yet), include cost of goods sold
