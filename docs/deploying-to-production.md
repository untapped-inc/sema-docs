# Deploying to production <small>Things are getting serious</small>

This section is a tutorial on how to deploy the system in production mode. The previous section was about running it locally and we strongly recommend that you go through the process before you start with this one because they have a lot in common.

In fact, this section is only meant to be a **best practices** tutorial when it comes to production deployment, so we will not go over some details that we covered in the Getting Started section, therefore, please, [go through it](getting-started.md) if you haven't done so yet.

!!! note
    Unless otherwise noted, all the instructions below should happen on the cloud, on your own SSH server. Not your personal computer.

## The SSH Server

### Prerequisites 1

From this point of this tutorial, here's what you'll need to follow along:

* A linux server - preferably Ubuntu - with SSH access. We recommend [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com)

### Creating a Sudo User

Assuming you got yourself an SSH server with root access, let's configure it.

Follow those steps to create a new sudo user so you don't have to login as root:

* Login to the server as the root user:
```
ssh root@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
```

!!! note ""
    Replace `SERVER_IP_ADDRESS` with the IP address of your SSH server
* Use the `adduser` command to add a new user to your system.
```
adduser username
```

!!! note ""
    * Be sure to replace `username` with the user that you want to create.
    * Set and confirm the new user's password at the prompt. A strong password is highly recommended!
    * Follow the prompts to set the new user's information. It is fine to accept the defaults to leave all of this information blank.

* Use the `usermod` command to add the user to the sudo group.
```
usermod -aG sudo username
```

!!! note ""
    By default, on Ubuntu, members of the sudo group have sudo privileges.

* Test sudo access on new user account
    * Use the `su` command to switch to the new user account.
       
        ```
        su - username
        ```
    
    * As the new user, verify that you can use sudo by prepending "sudo" to the command that you want to run with superuser privileges.

        ```
        sudo command_to_run
        ```
    
    * For example, you can list the contents of the /root directory, which is normally only accessible to the root user.
        
        ```
        sudo ls -la /root
        ```
   
    * The first time you use sudo in a session, you will be prompted for the password of the user account. Enter the password to proceed.

        !!! note ""
            If your user is in the proper group and you entered the password correctly, the command that you issued with sudo should run with root privileges.
            
* Logout of the sudo user account

    ```
    exit
    ```

* Logout of the root account

    ```
    exit
    ```

* From now on, only login through the sudo account you just created, it is not safe to access and deploy a project on an SSH server using root.

    ```
    ssh username@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
    ```

### Generating and Linking an SSH Key to Your Github Account

This one is an optional step. Linking an SSH key to your Github account will save you time when pulling from Github. It won't ask you for a password anymore.

!!! warning
    Notice our use of `pulling` here and not `pushing` too. We strongly discourage you to make changes to the codebase from a production server.

    If you're going to make changes that you want to save to your repo, make them on a development machine, push them to your repo and pull them from the production one.

This will also make your connection with Github even more secure.

Github already has great documentation for those:

1. Generating a new SSH key: [Github Docs](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#platform-linux)
2. Adding/Linking an SSH key to your Github account: [Github docs](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/#platform-linux)

## The Database

### Prerequisites 2

From this point of this tutorial, here's what you'll need to follow along:

* Install MySQL: Follow [this link for Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-16-04) Or find the right turorial for your version of Ubuntu.

### MySQL Secure Installation

While installing MySQL, you should have received a prompt to enter a password for the root MySQL user. You will need it for subsequent root connections.

With MySQL installed, let's start by running the `mysql_secure_installation` script that comes with MySQL:
```
mysql_secure_installation
```

!!! note ""
    This will show you some best practices for installing MySQL on a production server. It's up to you to activate/deactivate some options as suggested.
    
    Whatever you do here won't affect our deployment.

### Creating a new user and granting permissions

* Connect to the MySQL server as root:

```
mysql -uroot -p
```

* Create the new user

```
CREATE USER 'USERNAME'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD';
```

!!! note ""
    Make sure to replace `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` with your own values

* Grant privileges to the new user

```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'USERNAME'@'%';
```

!!! note ""
    The asterisks in this command refer to the database and table (respectively) that they can access. This specific command allows to the user to read, edit, execute and perform all tasks across all the databases and tables.

    In this example we are granting newuser full root access to everything in our database. While this is helpful for explaining some MySQL concepts, it may be impractical for most use cases and could put your databaseâ€™s security at high risk.

* Once you have finalized the permissions that you want to set up for your new users, always be sure to reload all the privileges.

```
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

* Logout of the root user connection.

```
exit
```

* Login as the new user.

```
mysqk -uUSERNAME -p
```

Now that your database is ready for production use, follow the instructions [over there](getting-started.md) to populate the basic data in its tables.

## Configurations

Let's now setup the configuration file, follow the instructions in [this sub-section](getting-started.md#configurations_1).

## The Back Office Web Client

### Prerequisites 3

From this point of this tutorial, here's what you'll need to follow along:

* Install nvm: Follow [this link](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) for instructions.
* Install latest LTS version of Node and npm: `nvm install --lts`
* Install Yarn: `npm i -g yarn`
* Install react-scripts (To be able to build the client): `yarn global add react-scripts`
* Nginx (Reverse Proxy): `sudo apt install nginx`
* Pm2 (Robust and easy to use process manager): `yarn global add pm2`
* Create a new root directory to contain the whole project: `mkdir sema`
* Move into the root directory: `cd sema`
* Create a new repository by forking the official back office web client repo through Github: Follow [this link](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) for instructions. Link to the repo: https://github.com/untapped-inc/sema-back-office-web
* Clone your new repository to a local directory: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sema-back-office-web.git` - Make sure to change ==YOUR-USERNAME== to your Github username or the one you chose to fork the repo for
* Move into the root directory of the back office web client: `cd sema-back-office-web`
* Install react-scripts (To be able to run the client): `yarn global add react-scripts`
* From this point on, we expect that you are in the root directory of the back office web client

### Building the client

Let's keep going by creating an optimized production build of the dashboard client:

* Install client dependencies: `yarn`
* Build the client: `yarn build`

!!! info ""
    If you get a fatal error about not having enough memory while building the client, just add this - `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false` - to the .env file of the back office web client directory and then run yarn build again:
    
    `echo 'GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false' >> .env && yarn build`

## The REST API

### Prerequisites 4

From this point of this tutorial, here's what you'll need to follow along:

* Assuming you are currently in the `sema-back-office-web` directory, move back into the root directory: `cd ..`
* Create a new repository by forking the official REST API repo through Github: Follow [this link](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) for instructions. Link to the repo: https://github.com/untapped-inc/sema-core
* Clone your new repository to a local directory: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sema-core.git` - Make sure to change ==YOUR-USERNAME== to your Github username or the one you chose to fork the repo for
* Move into the root directory of the REST API: `cd sema-core`
* From this point on, we expect that you are in the root directory of the REST API

### Serving the REST API

Now that we have the Back Office client ready to be served, let's:

* Create a new `public_react` directory: 

```
mkdir public_react
```

* Copy the entire build directory from the back office client `build` dir to the `public_react` directory:

```
cp -rf ../sema-back-office-web/build ./public_react
```
* Assuming you've [configured your `.env` file correctly](getting-started.md#configurations_1), install server dependencies: `yarn`
* Start the server with PM2: `pm2 start bin/www --name sema-server`.

!!! note ""
    Name it however you want so you can easily refer to it later.

* Get your server IP address.

```
curl icanhazip.com
```

* Test the server access via curl - Since we haven't configured Nginx yet, we'll test it from port 3001.

```
curl http://YOUR_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:3001/untapped/health-check
```

!!! note ""
    Replace `YOUR_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS` with your SSH server IP address.

    This should return something like `{"server":"Ok","database":"Ok"}`

* Setup Ngninx using [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-16-04)

* Configure Nginx by editing - *WITH SUPER USER* - /etc/nginx/sites-available/default.

```
sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

* Within the server block, there is an existing `location /` block. Replace the contents of that block with the following configuration.

```
location / {
	proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
	proxy_http_version 1.1;
	proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
	proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
	proxy_set_header Host $host;
	proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
}
```

* Make sure you didn't introduce any syntax errors: `sudo nginx -t`
* Restart Nginx: `sudo systemctl restart nginx`
* Test the server access without using the port:

```
curl http://YOUR-SERVER-IP-ADDRESS/untapped/health-check
```

!!! note ""
    This should return something like `{"server":"Ok","database":"Ok"}`.
    
    You can now setup DNS zone records for your server.

## The POS APK

### Prerequisites 5

From this point of this tutorial, here's what you'll need to follow along:

* Assuming you are currently in the `sema-core` directory, move back into the root directory: `cd ..`
* Create a new repository by forking the official POS mobile client repo through Github: Follow [this link](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) for instructions. Link to the repo: https://github.com/untapped-inc/sema-pos-mobile
* Clone your new repository to a local directory: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sema-pos-mobile.git` - Make sure to change ==YOUR-USERNAME== to your Github username or the one you chose to fork the repo for
* Move into the root directory of the POS mobile client: `cd sema-pos-mobile`
* From this point on, we expect that you are in the root directory of the POS mobile client

We will now build a customized version of the POS app.

!!! info ""
    For this part, do not do it on the SSH server. Do it locally on your development machine.

### Customizing

Customizing the POS app for your SWE is a breeze. Let's get to it.

#### Setting up

* Follow the Android setup steps at <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content" target="_blank">the official react native  docs</a>. Make sure you select the appropriate tabs in the instructions.
    * "Building Projects with Native Code"
    * "Development OS: macOS or Windows or Linux.
    * Target OS: Android"

#### Renaming the POS app

To rename the POS app, simply use our `rename` yarn/npm script.

```
yarn rename APPNAME "ON-SCREEN APP NAME"
```

!!! note ""
    The `rename` script takes two arguments, `APPNAME` and `ON-SCREEN APP NAME`.

    `APPNAME` is the internal name the Android application will use for the app.

    `ON-SCREEN APP NAME` is the name the user will see on the screen once the app is installed on the device. Notice how it's between quotes while `APPNAME` is not, the on-screen name can have spaces while the internal name cannot. i.e.:

    ```
    yarn rename JIBUPOS "SEMA Jibu"
    ```

#### Rebranding the POS app

Rebranding involves changing the logos on the POS app, the on-screen app logo and the background of the login screen.

At the time of writing, here's what the current logo looks like:
![Current SWE Logo](assets/images/swe-logo.png)

!!! note ""
    There's a white text on the logo, try to drag it around to notice it.

and here's what the background of the login screen looks like:
![Current Login Background](assets/images/swe-login.jpg)

Follow those steps to change those images to your liking:

* For the login screen background image, it must be a `jpg` file, simply replace the file located at `mobile_client/src/images/swe-login.jpg` with your own image. A good base size for this image would be a width of 758 and a height of 563 - 758 x 563.

!!! note ""
    Make sure you name your new image to `swe-login.jpg` or it will not show up on the POS app once it's built.

!!! info
    If your image is a `png` file, you can simply rename it to a `jpg` file, it will still work.

* For the logo and on-screen app image, it must be a `png` file. Rename your new logo to `ic_launcher.png`
* Go to the [NativeScrip Image Builder](http://nsimage.brosteins.com/) website
* In the `Upload an Image` section, select `Static Image - Android`
* Browse for your `ic_launcher.png` file
* Press `Upload App Image`

It will download the app images to your computer as a `zip` file.

* After extracting the `zip` file, rename the folders named `drawable-hdpi`, `drawable-mdpi`, `drawable-xhdpi` and `drawable-xxhdpi` to `mipmap-hdpi`, `mipmap-mdpi`, `mipmap-xhdpi` and `mipmap-xxhdpi` respectively.
* Select and copy the 4 new folders you just renamed and paste them in the directory located at `android/app/src/main/res`. Replace the ones that were already there.

Your app is now ready to be built.

### Building

To build the POS apk file simply use the `build_sema_apk.sh`.

```
sh build_sema_apk.sh
```

Here's an example usage of this script:
```
Generating the signing key
Password: // I enter my sudo user password
Enter keystore password: // I enter a new password for the keystore that's going to be generated
Re-enter new password: // I re-enter the same password for confirmation
What is your first and last name?
  [Unknown]:  Nick Rameau
What is the name of your organizational unit?
  [Unknown]:  Software Development
What is the name of your organization?
  [Unknown]:  Untapped, Inc.
What is the name of your City or Locality?
  [Unknown]:  Port-au-Prince
What is the name of your State or Province?
  [Unknown]:  Ouest
What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
  [Unknown]:  HT
Is CN=Nick Rameau, OU=Software Development, O="Untapped, Inc.", L=Port-au-Prince, ST=Ouest, C=HT correct?
  [no]:  yes

Generating 2,048 bit RSA key pair and self-signed certificate (SHA256withRSA) with a validity of 10,000 days
	for: CN=Nick Rameau, OU=Software Development, O="Untapped, Inc.", L=Port-au-Prince, ST=Ouest, C=HT
[Storing android/app/sema-pos-key.keystore]

Enter your keystore password again: // I re-enter my keystore password
Adding keystore password to the gradle config file
Generating the release APK

...

```

And you should get a `BUILD_SUCCESSFUL` message at the end of the script output message.

You now have an APK file of your customized POS app.

!!! info ""
    The APK file is located at `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release`. It's named `app-release.apk`. Feel free to rename this file however you like.

    The build script generated a `keystore` file at `android/app` named `sema-pos-key.keystore`.<br>You will need this file if you ever decide to host the APK file on the Google Play store. Without this file, you won't be able to send updates to the Play store for your app.

<!-- TODO: Add link to UI docs on how to connect to the server. -->

And that's it! You now have the whole platform running in production. Neat.
