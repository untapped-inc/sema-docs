See the official home page for more info. Click here to quickly get started. Under Construction This documentation currently goes under frequent updates. If you notice any missing part, it's probably being rewritten or updated at the moment. What is a Safe Water Enterprise? \u00b6 For those who just want to contribute to the codebase, you may want to know the impact of your contributions, so here's a quick background: A Safe Water Enterprise (SWE) is a sustainable solution to supply rural and peri-urban communities with safe drinking water. The concept combines a low-cost and low-maintenance membrane-based water treatment technology with an entrepreneurial approach for the sustainable management of the utility. SWEs are designed to meet the urgent need for access to safe water globally as well as to provide water related health knowledge through trainings and social marketing. Through their community based social enterprise approach, the SWEs are designed to provide a long-term sustainable solution at the kiosk level. Here's, for example, the organizational structure (at the time of writing) of dloHaiti, which is an SWE in Haiti: An HQ team that analyzises the kiosks data, makes decisions based on this data and provides support to kiosk staffs For each kiosk, a kiosk staff which comprises of at least 2 operators and 1 driver (for deliveries) There's more to it, but we keep it simple here. Now, SEMA aims to digitize the procedures that make up this structure and help SWEs scale faster with accurate and on-demand data by providing a set of useful tools through a mobile POS app (used by the kiosk operators) and a back office web app (used by the HQ team). You may want to do more research to get more accustomed to the users of the components that make up SEMA. Features \u00b6 Here's what's included in SEMA: A mobile POS - React Native - (Only Android for now ) that allows to: Browse and pick products Manage customers Manage inventory Process and manage (with limited actions) sales Process and manage loans Do all the above offline A back office on the web - Reacjs - that allows to: Make administrative actions: Manage Products Manage Users/Employees View Water Operations Reports View Sales Reports View Demographics Data View Volume Reports An API server - Nodejs/Expressjs - that acts as an intermediate between all the clients and the database See the Architecture and Components section for more.

The previous section was about running it locally and we strongly recommend that you go through the process before you start with this one because they have a lot in common. In fact, this section is only meant to be a best practices tutorial when it comes to production deployment, so we will not go over some details that we covered in the Getting Started section, therefore, please, go through it if you haven't done so yet. Note Unless otherwise noted, all the instructions below should happen on the cloud, on your own SSH server. Not your personal computer. The SSH Server \u00b6 Prerequisites 1 \u00b6 From this point of this tutorial, here's what you'll need to follow along: A linux server - preferably Ubuntu - with SSH access. We recommend DigitalOcean Creating a Sudo User \u00b6 Assuming you got yourself an SSH server with root access, let's configure it. Follow those steps to create a new sudo user so you don't have to login as root: Login to the server as the root user: 1 ssh root@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS Replace SERVER_IP_ADDRESS with the IP address of your SSH server Use the adduser command to add a new user to your system. 1 adduser username Be sure to replace username with the user that you want to create. Set and confirm the new user's password at the prompt. A strong password is highly recommended! Follow the prompts to set the new user's information. It is fine to accept the defaults to leave all of this information blank. Use the usermod command to add the user to the sudo group. 1 usermod -aG sudo username By default, on Ubuntu, members of the sudo group have sudo privileges. Test sudo access on new user account Use the su command to switch to the new user account. su - username As the new user, verify that you can use sudo by prepending \"sudo\" to the command that you want to run with superuser privileges. sudo command_to_run For example, you can list the contents of the /root directory, which is normally only accessible to the root user. sudo ls -la /root The first time you use sudo in a session, you will be prompted for the password of the user account. Enter the password to proceed. If your user is in the proper group and you entered the password correctly, the command that you issued with sudo should run with root privileges. Logout of the sudo user account exit Logout of the root account exit From now on, only login through the sudo account you just created, it is not safe to access and deploy a project on an SSH server using root. ssh username@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS Generating and Linking an SSH Key to Your Github Account \u00b6 This one is an optional step. Linking an SSH key to your Github account will save you time when pulling from Github. It won't ask you for a password anymore. Warning Notice our use of pulling here and not pushing too. We strongly discourage you to make changes to the codebase from a production server. If you're going to make changes that you want to save to your repo, make them on a development machine, push them to your repo and pull them from the production one. This will also make your connection with Github even more secure. Github already has great documentation for those: Generating a new SSH key: Github Docs Adding/Linking an SSH key to your Github account: Github docs The Database \u00b6 Prerequisites 2 \u00b6 From this point of this tutorial, here's what you'll need to follow along: Install MySQL: Follow this link for Ubuntu 16.04 Or find the right turorial for your version of Ubuntu. MySQL Secure Installation \u00b6 While installing MySQL, you should have received a prompt to enter a password for the root MySQL user. You will need it for subsequent root connections. With MySQL installed, let's start by running the mysql_secure_installation script that comes with MySQL: 1 mysql_secure_installation This will show you some best practices for installing MySQL on a production server. It's up to you to activate/deactivate some options as suggested. Whatever you do here won't affect our deployment. Creating a new user and granting permissions \u00b6 Connect to the MySQL server as root: 1 mysql -uroot -p Create the new user 1 CREATE USER 'USERNAME'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD'; Make sure to replace USERNAME and PASSWORD with your own values Grant privileges to the new user 1 GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'USERNAME'@'%'; The asterisks in this command refer to the database and table (respectively) that they can access. This specific command allows to the user to read, edit, execute and perform all tasks across all the databases and tables. In this example we are granting newuser full root access to everything in our database. While this is helpful for explaining some MySQL concepts, it may be impractical for most use cases and could put your database\u2019s security at high risk. Once you have finalized the permissions that you want to set up for your new users, always be sure to reload all the privileges. 1 FLUSH PRIVILEGES; Logout of the root user connection. 1 exit Login as the new user. 1 mysqk -uUSERNAME -p Now that your database is ready for production use, follow the instructions over there to populate the basic data in its tables. Configurations \u00b6 Let's now setup the configuration file, follow the instructions in this sub-section . The Back Office Web Client \u00b6 Prerequisites 3 \u00b6 From this point of this tutorial, here's what you'll need to follow along: Install nvm: Follow this link for instructions. Install latest LTS version of Node and npm: nvm install --lts Install Yarn: npm i -g yarn Install react-scripts (To be able to build the client): yarn global add react-scripts Nginx (Reverse Proxy): sudo apt install nginx Pm2 (Robust and easy to use process manager): yarn global add pm2 Create a new root directory to contain the whole project: mkdir sema Move into the root directory: cd sema Create a new repository by forking the official back office web client repo through Github: Follow this link for instructions. Link to the repo: https://github.com/untapped-inc/sema-back-office-web Clone your new repository to a local directory: git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sema-back-office-web.git - Make sure to change YOUR-USERNAME to your Github username or the one you chose to fork the repo for Move into the root directory of the back office web client: cd sema-back-office-web Install react-scripts (To be able to run the client): yarn global add react-scripts From this point on, we expect that you are in the root directory of the back office web client Building the client \u00b6 Let's keep going by creating an optimized production build of the dashboard client: Install client dependencies: yarn Build the client: yarn build If you get a fatal error about not having enough memory while building the client, just add this - GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false - to the .env file of the back office web client directory and then run yarn build again: echo 'GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false' >> .env && yarn build The REST API \u00b6 Prerequisites 4 \u00b6 From this point of this tutorial, here's what you'll need to follow along: Assuming you are currently in the sema-back-office-web directory, move back into the root directory: cd .. Create a new repository by forking the official REST API repo through Github: Follow this link for instructions. Link to the repo: https://github.com/untapped-inc/sema-core Clone your new repository to a local directory: git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sema-core.git - Make sure to change YOUR-USERNAME to your Github username or the one you chose to fork the repo for Move into the root directory of the REST API: cd sema-core From this point on, we expect that you are in the root directory of the REST API Serving the REST API \u00b6 Now that we have the Back Office client ready to be served, let's: Create a new public_react directory: 1 mkdir public_react Copy the entire build directory from the back office client build dir to the public_react directory: 1 cp -rf ../sema-back-office-web/build ./public_react Assuming you've configured your .env file correctly , install server dependencies: yarn Start the server with PM2: pm2 start bin/www --name sema-server . Name it however you want so you can easily refer to it later. Get your server IP address. 1 curl icanhazip.com Test the server access via curl - Since we haven't configured Nginx yet, we'll test it from port 3001. 1 curl http://YOUR_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:3001/untapped/health-check Replace YOUR_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS with your SSH server IP address. This should return something like {\"server\":\"Ok\",\"database\":\"Ok\"} Setup Ngninx using this tutorial Configure Nginx by editing - WITH SUPER USER - /etc/nginx/sites-available/default. 1 sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/default Within the server block, there is an existing location / block. Replace the contents of that block with the following configuration. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 location / { proxy_pass http : // localhost : 3001 ; proxy_http_version 1.1 ; proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade ; proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade' ; proxy_set_header Host $host ; proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade ; } Make sure you didn't introduce any syntax errors: sudo nginx -t Restart Nginx: sudo systemctl restart nginx Test the server access without using the port: 1 curl http://YOUR-SERVER-IP-ADDRESS/untapped/health-check This should return something like {\"server\":\"Ok\",\"database\":\"Ok\"} . You can now setup DNS zone records for your server. The POS APK \u00b6 Prerequisites 5 \u00b6 From this point of this tutorial, here's what you'll need to follow along: Assuming you are currently in the sema-core directory, move back into the root directory: cd .. Create a new repository by forking the official POS mobile client repo through Github: Follow this link for instructions. Link to the repo: https://github.com/untapped-inc/sema-pos-mobile Clone your new repository to a local directory: git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sema-pos-mobile.git - Make sure to change YOUR-USERNAME to your Github username or the one you chose to fork the repo for Move into the root directory of the POS mobile client: cd sema-pos-mobile From this point on, we expect that you are in the root directory of the POS mobile client We will now build a customized version of the POS app. For this part, do not do it on the SSH server. Do it locally on your development machine. Customizing \u00b6 Customizing the POS app for your SWE is a breeze. Let's get to it. Setting up \u00b6 Follow the Android setup steps at the official react native docs . Make sure you select the appropriate tabs in the instructions. \"Building Projects with Native Code\" \"Development OS: macOS or Windows or Linux. Target OS: Android\" Renaming the POS app \u00b6 To rename the POS app, simply use our rename yarn/npm script. 1 yarn rename APPNAME \"ON-SCREEN APP NAME\" The rename script takes two arguments, APPNAME and ON-SCREEN APP NAME . APPNAME is the internal name the Android application will use for the app. ON-SCREEN APP NAME is the name the user will see on the screen once the app is installed on the device. Notice how it's between quotes while APPNAME is not, the on-screen name can have spaces while the internal name cannot. i.e.: yarn rename JIBUPOS \"SEMA Jibu\" Rebranding the POS app \u00b6 Rebranding involves changing the logos on the POS app, the on-screen app logo and the background of the login screen. At the time of writing, here's what the current logo looks like: There's a white text on the logo, try to drag it around to notice it. and here's what the background of the login screen looks like: Follow those steps to change those images to your liking: For the login screen background image, it must be a jpg file, simply replace the file located at mobile_client/src/images/swe-login.jpg with your own image. A good base size for this image would be a width of 758 and a height of 563 - 758 x 563. Make sure you name your new image to swe-login.jpg or it will not show up on the POS app once it's built. Info If your image is a png file, you can simply rename it to a jpg file, it will still work. For the logo and on-screen app image, it must be a png file. Rename your new logo to ic_launcher.png Go to the NativeScrip Image Builder website In the Upload an Image section, select Static Image - Android Browse for your ic_launcher.png file Press Upload App Image It will download the app images to your computer as a zip file. After extracting the zip file, rename the folders named drawable-hdpi , drawable-mdpi , drawable-xhdpi and drawable-xxhdpi to mipmap-hdpi , mipmap-mdpi , mipmap-xhdpi and mipmap-xxhdpi respectively. Select and copy the 4 new folders you just renamed and paste them in the directory located at android/app/src/main/res . Replace the ones that were already there. Your app is now ready to be built. Building \u00b6 To build the POS apk file simply use the build_sema_apk.sh . 1 sh build_sema_apk.sh Here's an example usage of this script: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Generating the signing key Password: // I enter my sudo user password Enter keystore password: // I enter a new password for the keystore that's going to be generated Re-enter new password: // I re-enter the same password for confirmation What is your first and last name? [Unknown]: Nick Rameau What is the name of your organizational unit? [Unknown]: Software Development What is the name of your organization? [Unknown]: Untapped, Inc. What is the name of your City or Locality? [Unknown]: Port-au-Prince What is the name of your State or Province? [Unknown]: Ouest What is the two-letter country code for this unit? [Unknown]: HT Is CN=Nick Rameau, OU=Software Development, O=\"Untapped, Inc.\", L=Port-au-Prince, ST=Ouest, C=HT correct? [no]: yes Generating 2,048 bit RSA key pair and self-signed certificate (SHA256withRSA) with a validity of 10,000 days for: CN=Nick Rameau, OU=Software Development, O=\"Untapped, Inc.\", L=Port-au-Prince, ST=Ouest, C=HT [Storing android/app/sema-pos-key.keystore] Enter your keystore password again: // I re-enter my keystore password Adding keystore password to the gradle config file Generating the release APK ... And you should get a BUILD_SUCCESSFUL message at the end of the script output message. You now have an APK file of your customized POS app. The APK file is located at android/app/build/outputs/apk/release . It's named app-release.apk . Feel free to rename this file however you like. The build script generated a keystore file at android/app named sema-pos-key.keystore . You will need this file if you ever decide to host the APK file on the Google Play store. Without this file, you won't be able to send updates to the Play store for your app. And that's it! You now have the whole platform running in production. Neat. Where to go From Here? \u00b6 Now that you have SEMA running successfully for your SWE.

Windows Users We only cover *nix systems like Linux and OS X for now . Windows users will need to figure out alternatives on their own. 1 The Database \u00b6 Let's get started with the database. Prerequisites 1 \u00b6 From this point of this tutorial, here's what you'll need to follow along: Install MySQL: Follow this link for instructions for your system. Make sure you create an admin user, or using root is fine too. 3 Install nvm: Follow this link for instructions. Install latest LTS version of Node and npm: nvm install --lts Install Yarn: npm i -g yarn Configurations \u00b6 Assuming you've successfully installed MySQL on your system and created an admin user (not root ), let's start creating the sema_core database and populating the basic data for the project. Creating the database \u00b6 Here are the steps to follow: Open your MySQL Workbench Go to File > Open SQL Script... Find your repository folder and choose the file database > create_schema.sql Go to Query > Execute (All or Selection). It will run the script and create your new database This will create a new database named sema_core . If you want to rename it, either use a tool like MySQL Workbench or make sure you edit the create_schema.sql file fromt this line: CREATE SCHEMA sema_core; before you Execute it. Populating the required tables \u00b6 Now that the database is created, let's populate some tables in there. Feel free to change the values to what you want, except where it's mentioned to keep them as is. Let's start by populating the MySQL views necessary: Still in MySQL Workbench, using the same steps above, select the customer_details_view.sql located in the database folder and run it. Then do the same for the receipt_details_view.sql file. Let's add a role 1 2 INSERT INTO ` role ` ( ` id ` , ` authority ` , ` code ` ) VALUES ( 1 , 'Admin' , 'admin' ); Then the user: 1 2 INSERT INTO ` user ` ( ` id ` , ` username ` , ` email ` , ` password ` , ` first_name ` , ` last_name ` ) VALUES ( 1 , 'administrator' , 'admin@untapped-inc.com' , 'USER_PASSWORD' , 'Admin' , 'User' ); Note Notice the USER_PASSWORD placeholder for this user. Here's how to get it: First, install the bcrypt-cli npm package globally: yarn global add bcrypt-cli Then run the following command to get the encrypted password: bcrypt-cli \"AdminPassword\" 10 Replace AdminPassword with the one you want and keep the last value to 10. This is the bcrypt salt round, you'll know why we use it in the Configurations sub-section. Then use this encrypted password for this customer. Repeat the last step for subsequent ones. Let's now map the user to the role 1 INSERT INTO ` user_role ` ( ` role_id ` , ` user_id ` ) VALUES ( 1 , 1 ); Now, time to add a country: 1 2 INSERT INTO ` country ` ( ` id ` , ` name ` ) VALUES ( 1 , 'Haiti' ); Now, let's add a region: 1 2 INSERT INTO ` region ` ( ` id ` , ` name ` , ` description ` , ` country_id ` ) VALUES ( 1 , 'Ouest' , 'On the West side' , 1 ); Next, add a kiosk/site: 1 2 INSERT INTO ` kiosk ` ( ` id ` , ` name ` , ` region_id ` ) VALUES ( 1 , 'Bois9' , 1 ); Now, add a few customer types: 1 2 3 4 INSERT INTO ` customer_type ` ( ` id ` , ` name ` ) VALUES ( 1 , 'anonymous' ); INSERT INTO ` customer_type ` ( ` id ` , ` name ` ) VALUES ( 2 , 'Small Store' ); Note The anonymous type is required. Do not change it. Now for the sales channels: 1 2 3 4 INSERT INTO ` sales_channel ` ( ` id ` , ` name ` , ` description ` ) VALUES ( 1 , 'reseller' , 'Resellers' ); INSERT INTO ` sales_channel ` ( ` id ` , ` name ` , ` description ` ) VALUES ( 2 , 'direct' , 'Customers that walk up to the kiosk' ); Next, add a couple of customers: 1 2 3 4 INSERT INTO ` customer_account ` ( ` id ` , ` name ` , ` customer_type_id ` , ` sales_channel_id ` , ` kiosk_id ` , ` address_line1 ` , ` gps_coordinates ` , ` phone_number ` ) VALUES ( 'CUSTOMER_UUID' , 'Direct Client' , 2 , 2 , 1 , '--------------------' , 'gps' , '---------------------' ); INSERT INTO ` customer_account ` ( ` id ` , ` name ` , ` customer_type_id ` , ` sales_channel_id ` , ` kiosk_id ` , ` address_line1 ` , ` phone_number ` ) VALUES ( 'CUSTOMER_UUID' , 'Chez Matilda' , 1 , 1 , 1 , '25, rue Fernand' , '+50937120500' ); Info Notice the CUSTOMER_UUID placeholder value for those customers. Here's how to get them: First, install the uuid npm package globally: yarn global add uuid Then simply run uuid to generate a uuid in your terminal: uuid Then use this uuid for one customer by replacing the CUSTOMER_UUID placeholder with it. Repeat the last two steps for subsequent ones. Now it's time to add some product categories: 1 2 INSERT INTO ` product_category ` ( ` id ` , ` description ` , ` name ` ) VALUES ( 1 , 'Water products' , 'water_products' ); Then add a product 1 2 INSERT INTO ` product ` ( ` id ` , ` name ` , ` sku ` , ` description ` , ` category_id ` , ` price_amount ` , ` price_currency ` , ` unit_per_product ` , ` unit_measure ` , ` cogs_amount ` , ` base64encoded_image ` ) VALUES ( 1 , '5.0L bottle' , 'MD5G' , '5 Liter water bottle' , 1 , 4000 . 00 , 'UGX' , 5 , 'liters' , 2000 . 00 , 'PRODUCT_BASE64_ENCODED_IMAGE' ); Note As of now, you must have at least one product with a unit_measure value of liters . Notice the PRODUCT_BASE64_ENCODED_IMAGE . It's the image that shows up for the product. We use base64 encoded images instead of PNG files. To get your own base64 version of your product image, you can use an online tool for that. We personally like to use this tool . Once you get the base64 encoded image from the tool, simply replace the PRODUCT_BASE64_ENCODED_IMAGE placeholder with it. Finally, let's map the product to the sales channel and the kiosk 1 2 3 4 INSERT INTO ` product_mrp ` ( ` id ` , ` kiosk_id ` , ` product_id ` , ` sales_channel_id ` , ` price_amount ` , ` price_currency ` , ` cogs_amount ` ) VALUES ( 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , '4000.00' , 'UGX' , '2000.00' ); INSERT INTO ` product_mrp ` ( ` id ` , ` kiosk_id ` , ` product_id ` , ` sales_channel_id ` , ` price_amount ` , ` price_currency ` , ` cogs_amount ` ) VALUES ( 2 , 1 , 1 , 2 , '4000.00' , 'UGX' , '2000.00' ); Your database is now ready. To learn more about the database schema, please click here . The REST API Server \u00b6 Let's move on to the REST API. Prerequisites 2 \u00b6 From this point of this tutorial, here's what you'll need to follow along: Create a new root directory to contain the whole project: mkdir sema Move into the root directory: cd sema Create a new repository by forking the official REST API repo through Github: Follow this link for instructions. Link to the repo: https://github.com/untapped-inc/sema-core Clone your new repository to a local directory: git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sema-core.git - Make sure to change YOUR-USERNAME to your Github username or the one you chose to fork the repo for Move into the root directory of the REST API: cd sema-core From this point on, we expect that you are in the root directory of the REST API Configurations \u00b6 Before you can start running the server, you will need to first set the property values in the configurations file. This configurations file is located in the root directory of the REST API as .example-env . It's a dot file, so if you want to see it from your terminal, you need to add the -a flag to your ls: ls -a . First, rename this file from .example-env to .env : cp .example-env .env Then move it to the parent directory (which should be sema if you were following along): mv .env ../.env Now open this .env file using your favorite text editor. These properties provide the necessary details for the clients and the server to access the database and setup a few dependencies. Use the DB credentials you created while installing and setting up MySQL. Property Name Description DB_HOST The URL to the database server location E.g. localhost DB_USER The user who has access to this database E.g. untapped DB_PASSWORD The user password for this database E.g. semaIsAwesome 2 DB_SCHEMA The actual name of the database/schema E.g. sema_core DB_DIALECT The SQL dialect used by the DB. E.g. mysql . DEFAULT_TABLES The tables that must be populated - postinstall - by sequelize-auto by default E.g. user,role,user_role . We recommend you keep it to the default value. JWT_SECRET JSON Web Token secret used to encrypt the token. E.g. f8d74387h8undgs87 . Don't use this example, type in anything in there to make it hard to guess, this is some kind of password that will be used between the clients and the server. JWT_EXPIRATION_LENGTH Length of time the token is valid for. E.g. 1 day BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS How much time is needed to calculate a single BCrypt hash - Between 8 and 12 is recommended. Used for encrypting passwords for users. Remember, changing this requires that you use the same salt rounds value when creating a new password on the user table. E.g. 10 Danger We Strongly recommend that you do not to push the .env file to your repository after adding the correct configuration property values. For security measures, we added it to the project's .gitignore file so that git can always ignore it. So you would need to really want to push it to be able to do so. Running the server \u00b6 Now that your database and your configurations are all set. Let's run the server, shall we? Install dependencies: yarn Run the server: yarn start It should start running at http://localhost:3001 Let's test that it's running fine with curl: 1 curl http://localhost:3001/sema/health-check It should return something like: {\"server\":\"Ok\",\"database\":\"Ok\",\"version\":\"0.0.1.4\",\"schema\":\"sema_core\"} The version number may vary. Note The clients are configured to access the server on port 3001. To learn more about the REST API server, please click here . The Back Office Web Client \u00b6 Time to run the back office. Prerequisites 3 \u00b6 From this point of this tutorial, here's what you'll need to follow along: Assuming you are currently in the sema-core directory, move back into the root directory: cd .. Create a new repository by forking the official back office web client repo through Github: Follow this link for instructions. Link to the repo: https://github.com/untapped-inc/sema-back-office-web Clone your new repository to a local directory: git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sema-back-office-web.git - Make sure to change YOUR-USERNAME to your Github username or the one you chose to fork the repo for Move into the root directory of the back office web client: cd sema-back-office-web Install react-scripts (To be able to run the client): yarn global add react-scripts From this point on, we expect that you are in the root directory of the back office web client Running the Back Office Web Client \u00b6 Now it's time to run the back office client. Here are the steps to follow: Install dependencies: yarn Run the client: yarn start It should start running at http://localhost:3000 Notice the port number: 3000 Go to the above link and test the client by logging in with the user credentials you created during the database setup . To learn more about the back office, please click here . The POS Mobile Client \u00b6 Finally, let's run the POS client. Prerequisites 4 \u00b6 From this point of this tutorial, here's what you'll need to follow along: Assuming you are currently in the sema-back-office-web directory, move back into the root directory: cd .. Create a new repository by forking the official POS mobile client repo through Github: Follow this link for instructions. Link to the repo: https://github.com/untapped-inc/sema-pos-mobile Clone your new repository to a local directory: git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sema-pos-mobile.git - Make sure to change YOUR-USERNAME to your Github username or the one you chose to fork the repo for Move into the root directory of the POS mobile client: cd sema-pos-mobile From this point on, we expect that you are in the root directory of the POS mobile client Running the POS mobile client \u00b6 Follow the Android setup steps at the official react native docs . Make sure you select the appropriate tabs in the instructions. \"Building Projects with Native Code\" \"Development OS: macOS or Windows or Linux. Target OS: Android\" Install dependencies: yarn Create and open an emulator either by using Genymotion or the Android Studio AVD Use at least a 7 inch tablet with a minimum Android version of 6.0.0 Start the app on the emulator: react-native run-android You should get the Settings page. From there, fill up the form to make the connection between the mobile client and the server: Settings Field Description SEMA Service URL The URL to the running server. Since we're on local, we just need to get the current IP address of our system using ifconfig . E.g.: http://192.168.1.7:3001. Notice the port number of the server at the end. Site The kiosk that we created during database setup . E.g.: Bois9 Username or Email This is the user we just used to login to the dashboard client. E.g. Administrator Password The password of the above user E.g. diueh89ndys Then choose a language and press the Connect button. It should connect successfully and you will be able to test the whole app. Where to go from here? \u00b6 And that's it folks. You now have the whole platform running successfully on your own computer for testing and/or development purposes.
